# alluvial-pbiviz
Alluvial chart based on D3, rawgraphs, and other design based sankey diagrams on the web, written in typescript as a powerbi customer visual.

Alluvials are a very compelling and visually stunning way to represent (the right) data.  As such this project attempts to bring some of that visual appeal into Power BI with customized visualisation properties and some out of the box "make it pretty" settings for those not as design inclined.

Very early days, current version looks something like the below.  

Colours range was generated from d3.interpolateCubehelix("#AC0086", "#FFA500");
